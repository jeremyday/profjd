## C# Template

Below is a starter template for standalone C# code.

[CSharpStarterTemplate.cs](/assets/CSharpStarterTemplate.cs)
{% highlight c# %}
using System;

namespace MonoTests
{
  class MainClass
  {
    public static void Main (string[] args)
    {
      Console.WriteLine ("Hello World!");
    }
  }
}
{% endhighlight %}
